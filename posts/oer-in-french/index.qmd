For the ["Journée d'Innovation Pédagogique"](https://prof-ets.etsmtl.ca/journee-dinnovation-pedagogique/) of the ÉTS, I presented the work I did on creating an Open Education Resource (OER) for a course I teach.

Thanks to funding from the [fabriqueREL](https://fabriqueRel.org), my university ([ÉTS](https://www.etsmtl.ca)) was able to produce an Open Educational Resource (OER or _Ressource Éducative Libre_) for the [manual](https://fuhrmanator.github.io/log210-ndc-quarto/) of the course I teach called _Analyse et conception de logiciels_ (Software analysis and design).
It has been released under the Creative Commons license, and was created using Quarto (the next generation of R Markdown) software.

Here are a couple of presentations about the process and product:

- [Creating an OER with Open Source Tools](../../presentations/open-source-tools-fabriqueREL2023.html) (presentation in French and English)
- [L'autoéquipement dans la création d'une REL](../../presentations/autoequipement-REL-ACFAS-2023.html) "Dogfooding while creating an OER" (presentation in French).
