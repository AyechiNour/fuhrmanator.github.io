title: Enhancing Genericity and Concretization in ts2famix and TypeScript Metamodel
---

The ts2famix npm package provides the ability to analyze TypeScript projects by breaking down their components and generating a model with detailed information. However, both ts2famix and our metamodel initially had limitations in accurately recognizing parametric elements and concretization relationships. During my Summer 2024 internship, I focused on improving the recognition of these elements and their representation, enhancing their accuracy in both the ts2famix-generated JSON file and our metamodel.

## Assumptions

In this post, we assume familiarity with TypeScript’s generic types and their usage. We’ll explore how generics and concretization relationships are represented in both our metamodel and ts2famix.

## Understanding Genericity and Concretization

Genericity refers to the ability to define classes, methods, or types that can operate on different data types. In TypeScript, generics allow developers to write reusable code that can handle various data types while maintaining type safety. 

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="classA.PNG" alt="parametric class" />
</div>

For example, a generic class like `ClassA` can be defined with a type parameter `T`, making it flexible to work with different types, but it cannot be used without specifying the type for `T`.

Concretization occurs when these generic types are assigned specific values or types, turning abstract type parameters into concrete instances. 

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="parametricClassWithType.PNG" alt="parametric class with type String" style="width: 50%;"/>
</div>

In the case of `ClassA`, concretization would involve setting `T` to a specific type like `String`.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="concretization.PNG" alt="concretization" style="width: 50%;"/>
</div>

In this example, we have two classes: `ClassA<T>`, a generic class with the parameter `T`, and `ClassA<String>`, a concrete class where `T` is specified as `String`. This illustrates a concretization relationship between `ClassA<T>` and `ClassA<String>`, as well as a parameter concretization relationship between the generic parameter `T` and the concrete parameter `String`.

(note : This example is explained in detail throughout this <a href="https://modularmoose.org/posts/2023-07-13-parametric">blog post</a>.)

## Implementation in Our Metamodel

Now that we’ve established a theoretical understanding of generics and concretization, we can see how these concepts were implemented in our metamodel. 

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="model.png" alt="model" style="width: 90%;"/>
</div>

Our metamodel includes 8 new classes: 

 _ Five representing the core generic structures: `ParametricClass`, `ParametricInterface`, `ParametricFunction`, `ParametricMethod`, and `ParametricArrowFunction`.

 _ One: `ParameterType`, which refers to the parameters of a parametric element.

 _ And two classes, `Concretisation` and `ParameterConcretisation`, defining relationships between parametric elements and between parameter types, respectively.

The use of traits has been key in organizing parametric elements and concretizations, allowing us to handle them in a structured, modular way. 

We have 5 new traits in our meta-model:

 _ `TParametricEntity` is a general type used by all parametric entities, including `ParametricClass`, `ParametricInterface`, `ParametricFunction`, `ParametricMethod`, and `ParametricArrowFunction`.

 _ `TConcreteParameterType` represents concrete parameters 
 
 _ `TGenericParameterType` represents generic parameters.  

 _ `TConcretisation` establishes a link between two `TParametricEntity` instances. A `TParametricEntity` can have one or more concretizations with other `TParametricEntity` objects. Each `TParametricEntity` that is a concretization of another holds a reference to its generic entity.  

 _ `TParameterConcretisation` works similarly to `TConcretisation`, but instead of linking two `TParametricEntity` instances, it connects a `TConcreteParameterType` with a `TGenericParameterType`. A `TGenericParameterType` can have multiple concretizations, and a `TConcreteParameterType` contains references to its generics.

## Unified Approach in the Metamodel and ts2famix

Both our metamodel and the ts2famix npm package share a consistent approach to representing generics and concretization relationships. In our metamodel, parametric elements and their concretizations are modeled clearly to reflect the relationships between abstract types and their concrete instances. These representations are aligned with how ts2famix handles generics in TypeScript projects, ensuring that improvements in the recognition of parametric elements are mirrored in both the model and the code analysis process.

## Conclusion

In this post, we’ve explored how generics and concretization relationships are modeled both in our metamodel and the ts2famix npm package. By ensuring a consistent approach across both systems, we’ve enhanced the accuracy and usability of these parametric elements in TypeScript project analysis.
